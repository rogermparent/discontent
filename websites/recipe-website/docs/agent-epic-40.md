# Epic 40 — Import polish, test and CI hygiene, quick wins, term clouds measured, Thanksgiving

**Now:** started 2026-10-17 (overnight, unattended); 39f applied; wave 1 —
40a ∥ 40b, 40e research alongside.

## Context

Roger, 2026-10-17, after epic 39's code closed: "All your recommendations
sound good. Implement and let's plan next steps after that." He picked four
directions — import/LLM polish, test/CI hygiene, the quick-wins bundle, and
Thanksgiving content — and chose to measure the term clouds before deciding
on them. F32 borrowing stays parked. Then: "Consider you'll be working on
this overnight — prioritize autonomy and add extra work if you expect to
finish the current queue quickly." So the epic runs unattended and carries
an extra queue (40f–40h) for the rest of the night.

## Decisions

### D1 — Nothing waits on Roger overnight

Where a phase meets a choice, it takes the conservative, reversible option,
records it in its Results as **"Roger to confirm"**, and keeps going. The
close-out lists every such item. GPU checks wait at most ~15 min for the
other GPU user to pause; otherwise they are recorded "pending GPU".

### D2 — 40e imports without a pre-approval round, under strict rules

A Thanksgiving candidate is imported only if it fills a named gap, comes
from a reputable recipe site with structured data (Sally's first), has no
near-duplicate in the repo, reads grounded in the dry run (no
`--allow-partial`), has an image, and gets the skill-v4 facets plus
`thanksgiving`. At most 12. Anything borderline goes on a "for Roger" list
here and is not imported. Every import is one commit (so `git revert`
undoes it), nothing is deleted, and homepage features stay as they are
(Halloween is current); the close-out carries a ready command to feature
`thanksgiving` after Oct 31.

### D3 — Term clouds: measure, then decide

40d measures the clouds' read and render cost and the fan-out of one tag
write in production mode against a scratch copy of the real repo. **Go**
if a cloud read costs more than ~100 ms on the workstation (≈ 0.4 s on the
Pi) or one tag write expires more than ~10 cloud-rendering pages: key the
clouds per term as 32e keyed by-term (a spec version bump; 39b's stamp
rebuilds the indexes by itself). Otherwise a recorded no-go with the
numbers and a reopen trigger.

### D4 — Dependency updates are patch and minor only

40h moves no major version (no Next major, no Tailwind or React line
change). One PR; a package whose update fails a gate is skipped and
recorded. Picking the change up on the workstation stays Roger's
(`pnpm workstation update`).

Ordering, in waves: 40a ∥ 40b (editor llm vs resume-builder/portfolio/CI,
disjoint), with 40e's research and dry run in the orchestrator alongside;
then 40c ∥ 40d; 40e's real apply once its dry run's diff is reviewed; then
the extra queue 40f → 40g → 40h, two at a time while the night lasts (each
independent; anything not started stays in the backlog); then 40-close.

## How it runs

- One orchestrating session; code phases go to worktree workers, each its own
  PR off fresh `origin/main`, opened ready after a local review. A read-only
  review agent reviews each M/L PR. Merge when every check that ran is green
  and the PR is `CLEAN`; merge commit; delete the branch. The next PR merges
  main before it merges. At most two PRs in CI at once.
- Machine memory: typecheck, vitest and builds go through
  `orchestrator/heavy.sh`, Playwright through `heavy-pw.sh` (the same
  machine-wide slot the other overnight session uses), at most two heavy
  workers at once. GPU real checks go through the orchestrator, which
  pauses the other GPU user first. No real model or API call in tests or CI.
- Never deploy, never push the content repo, never `pnpm workstation
update`, never commit `editor/content`.

## Phases

### 40a — Import / LLM polish (S–M)

- A smaller `num_ctx` for short inputs (39-Ta6): extraction picks a context
  from the input's estimated tokens plus the output budget, clamped to
  4096…`LLM_NUM_CTX`, in steps so Ollama doesn't reload for every page
  size. The reading cache key and the context: kept apart, or why not.
- Placement wording: a partial GPU share with nothing else holding VRAM
  beyond the idle baseline says the model doesn't fit beside the desktop's
  ~N GB at this context, not "another program holds VRAM".
- `RECIPE_LLM_API=openai` against Ollama's `/v1`: detect it and use the
  native unload and placement, or keep it a documented trap (36/38 Te7).
- `form-url` batch rows on `/jobs/<id>` show dish names (37 backlog, 38b).
- GPU real check through the orchestrator: one typical page import, the
  context chosen and the GPU share.

### 40b — Test / CI hygiene (S–M)

- resume-builder's 7 red specs (39-Te2): per spec, regression (fix the
  app) or stale spec (fix the spec), each verdict recorded.
- A path-filtered CI job for resume-builder's Playwright suite
  (`websites/resume-builder/**`, `packages/**`, the lockfile).
- Portfolio's production build passing ~4 GB of heap: a fix, or a scoped
  `NODE_OPTIONS` in its e2e script.

### 40c — Quick wins (S–M)

- `shopping remove --for <slug>` on the CLI and as a field of MCP
  `shopping_remove` (39-Dc3); tool counts stay 57/43.
- A bounded retry for a failed start-time rebuild (39b-L5): a few attempts
  over ~20 min, stopping on success or a newer HEAD move, never a tight
  `busy` loop.
- The editor's native Select and Checkbox controls onto the Radix `ui/*`
  primitives, keeping form submission by `name`.

### 40d — Term clouds: measure, then decide (S, M if go)

- D3. `/tags`, the tag autocomplete route, the ⌘K data and `/make`: read
  and render cost; one tag write's invalidation fan-out; scaled to the Pi
  by epic 29's ratio.

### 40e — Thanksgiving content round (S–M, real repo)

- D2. Gaps in `tag:thanksgiving` (30 recipes): gravy; Brussels sprouts or
  green sides beyond the casserole; mac and cheese; cornbread or cornbread
  dressing; make-ahead mashed potatoes; leftover-turkey dishes beyond the
  pot pie; 2–3 Thanksgiving drinks (cider or cranberry). 8–12 candidates,
  Sally's first, polite scraping (30-D5), scratch-clone dry run reviewed
  before the real apply.

### 40f — Flake hunt (S–M, extra queue)

- Tests that failed and then passed on retry in the last ~50 CI runs, fixed
  at the root (waits, explicit slugs, isolation), never by raising
  timeouts; each fix passes `--repeat-each 5` in build mode. README's test
  section checked against Playwright.

### 40g — Accessibility coverage (S–M, extra queue)

- The axe specs extended to `/shopping`, `/jobs` and a job page, `/git`,
  `/make`, the Export settings page and the term edit form; real
  violations fixed.

### 40h — Patch / minor dependency updates (M, extra queue)

- D4. One PR, the lockfile regenerated through the heavy slot, full CI as
  the gate, the lockfile diff reviewed for unexpected majors.

### 40-close (S)

- Close-out (with the "Roger to confirm" list and 40e's review list on
  top), the CLAUDE.md "Durable docs" bullet, backlog rows, memory, Roger's
  steps.

## Verification

- Every PR: `pnpm --filter recipe-editor typecheck`, `pnpm --filter
recipe-website exec tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm exec vitest run` (with counts),
  the touched Playwright specs by exact name in build mode — all through
  the heavy slot — then CI green and `CLEAN`.
- 40a: unit tests for the context choice (short → 4096, long → full, steps
  stable), the placement wording (baseline vs another holder), the `/v1`
  path (fetch stubbed); a real import on the GPU through the orchestrator.
- 40b: resume-builder's suite green locally and in its new CI job (shown
  running on the PR); portfolio's production build completes in the slot.
- 40c: CLI and MCP `--for` tests (tool count unchanged, the curator-skill
  test); retry tests on a frozen clock; form-submission and accessibility
  specs green, moved baselines reviewed.
- 40d: measurements and the go/no-go here; if go, unit tests per keyed
  read and a spec version bump.
- 40e: the import rules checked per candidate, rejects with reasons; the
  dry run reviewed before the real apply; `tag:thanksgiving` before and
  after; pages checked on the workstation.
- 40f: each fixed spec passes `--repeat-each 5` in build mode.
- 40g: the new axe checks green.
- 40h: the full suite green locally and on CI (all 14 checks).
